# Video-Game-Sales-Prediction-and-Analytics-Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes and predicts video game sales using a comprehensive dataset of over 16,900 records, covering game titles, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, sales figures, critic/user scores, and ratings. The goal is to uncover sales trends, classify games as "hit" or "not hit," predict sales, and provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

- **Dataset:** [Video Game Sales and Ratings on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings/data)
- **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQLite, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**  
  Addressed missing values, standardized data types, and created new features to improve model performance and analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Explored sales trends by platform, genre, region, and publisher to identify key patterns and insights.

- **Dimensionality Reduction & Modeling:**  
  Applied PCA to reduce feature dimensionality and built classification models (including KNN) to predict whether a game would be a "hit" or not. Also developed regression models for sales prediction and a recommendation system for personalized game suggestions.

- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:**  
  Developed a dashboard with interactive visuals and KPI indicators, enabling users to explore sales data, model predictions, and key business metrics dynamically.
